        <img src= "37625.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Picture of an Asian gate"> As you can see, our heading didn't really do so well. It says, Don't
        be afraid to be more and there's a whole bunch of words missing here. 
        Well the reason this is going on is because the browser is interpreting 
        this left angle bracket as a beginning of a tag. And then it looks at 
        the word then. It doesn't quite understand what kind of a tag that is 
        and basically skips just about everything between the left angle bracket 
        and the right angle bracket and just says the word more. So we could fix 
        that very easily with substituting the &lt; angle bracket with the&nbsp;HTML&nbsp;entity 
        reference
