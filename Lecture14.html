        <h1>Main Heading</h1>
        <p>The first paragraph that's supposed to have lots of info but 
            as one would have it, things don't actually go the way you 
            want so one just has to improvise most of the time and hope things 
            work out. I guess at this point I'm just ranting aren't I.
        </p>
        <p class = "highlight">
            This be the one that I specified for changes with the css. So it should 
            be different from the first one if things should go well.
        </p>
        <h2>Subheading</h2>
        <span class="highlight">This shit should turn green and nothing else</span>
        <div><span class="highlight mainPoint">Right now I think I'm just 
            experimenting. But las las it should look like something that ads coke.
